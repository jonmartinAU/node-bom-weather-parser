======

A simple script for downloading XML from the [Bureau of Meteorology](http://www.bom.gov.au)'s public FTP server.
  
I am building a JavaScript Weather app and [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) does not support FTP. This script is so I can host the XML on my server, convert to JSON and use in my app.
